 * - 2D is standard simplex, modified to support larger kernels.

 * - 3D is "Re-oriented 8-point BCC noise" which constructs a
 *   congruent BCC lattice in a much different way than usual.
 * - 4D uses a na√Øve pregenerated lookup table, and averages out
 *   to the expected performance.
 *
 * Multiple versions of each function are provided. See the
 * documentation above each, for more info.
